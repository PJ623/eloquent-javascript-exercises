    <h1>A List</h1>
    <p>
        Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure like the previous one when given [1, 2, 3] as argument, and
        write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Also write the helper functions prepend, which takes
        an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which
        takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list, or undefined when there is no
        such element. If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
