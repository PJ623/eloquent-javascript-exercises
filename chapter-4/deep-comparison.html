    <h1>Deep Comparison</h1>
    <p>
        The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.
        Write a function, deepEqual, that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects
        with the same properties whose values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual. To find out
        whether to compare two things by identity (use the === operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you
        can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have
        to take one silly exception into account: by a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".
