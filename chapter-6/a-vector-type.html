    <h1>A Vector Type</h1>
    <p>
        Write a constructor Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which
        it should save to properties of the same name. Give the Vector prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another
        vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (the one in this
        and the parameter) x and y values. Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of the
        vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).
