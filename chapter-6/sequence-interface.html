    <h1>Sequence Interface</h1>
    <p>
        Design an interface that abstracts iteration over a collection of values. An object that provides this interface represents
        a sequence, and the interface must somehow make it possible for code that uses such an object to iterate over the
        sequence, looking at the element values it is made up of and having some way to find out when the end of the sequence
        is reached. When you have specified your interface, try to write a function logFive that takes a sequence object
        and calls console.log on its first five elementsâ€”or fewer, if the sequence has fewer than five elements. Then implement
        an object type ArraySeq that wraps an array and allows iteration over the array using the interface you designed.
        Implement another object type RangeSeq that iterates over a range of integers (taking from and to arguments to its
        constructor) instead.
