    <h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
    <p>
        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible
        by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When
        you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and
        still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those). (This is actually an interview question
        that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re
        now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
