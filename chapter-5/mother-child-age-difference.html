    <h1>Mother-Child Age Difference</h1>
    <p>
        Using the example data set from this chapter, compute the average age difference between mothers and children (the age of
        the mother when the child is born). You can use the average function defined earlier in this chapter. Note that not
        all the mothers mentioned in the data are themselves present in the array. The byName object, which makes it easy
        to find a personâ€™s object from their name, might be useful here.
