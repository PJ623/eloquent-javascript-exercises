    <h1>Historical Life Expectancy</h1>
    <p>
        When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came
        out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at that phenomenon. Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry
        data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding
        it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).
