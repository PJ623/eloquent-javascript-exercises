    <h1>Bean Counting</h1>
    <p>
        You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length
        with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first
        character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words,
        a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1. Write a function countBs that takes
        a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
        Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates
        the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make
        use of this new function.
